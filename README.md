# Facial Landmarks Detection Using Mediapipe Library

## Abstract
Facial landmarks detection has come to be applied in various fields, ranging from the generation of facial filters in social media applications like snap chat to security and identity verification i.e. iris detection. In this project, a facial landmarks detection model is implemented using Mediapipe solution packages. The facial landmarks solution offers multiple implementations including image-based and real-time detection with allowance for a defined number of faces per instance. The model successfully detects facial landmarks even on faces positioned at an angle
